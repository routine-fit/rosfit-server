## Basic structure and configurations

```
src/                          // container to other folders with the source code of the app
  config/                     // configuration files
  constants/                  // global constants
  interfaces/                 // global interfaces
  middlewares/                // functions that should run on before some requests
    validations.ts            // validation that are being used on the middlewares
  models/                     // mongoose model schemes
  routes/                     // server routes
    public/                   // routes that can be request by anyone
    resource/                 // resource folder
      controllers.ts          // functions that are being used on the routes
      index.ts                // routes of the resource
      types.ts                // types that are needed on the resource
      resource.test.ts        // test of the resource
      validations.ts          // validate schemes
    index.ts                  // all the defined routes for the server
  utils/                      // reusable functions
  app.ts                      // server app
  index.ts                    // main file
.env                          // environment variables
package.json                  // deps and workspace scripts
tsconfig.json                 // typescript configuration
nodemon.json                  // nodemon configuration
README.md                     // docs are important
```

## Resource structure

**Note**: Consider that is not required to have on all cases the `routes` folder

Each Resource must follow the next structure and the name of it must be in `kebab-case`:

```
example/
  sub-route-a/
    sub-route-c/
    controllers.ts
    index.ts
    types.ts
    validations.ts
    sub-route-a.test.ts
  sub-route-b/
    controllers.ts
    index.ts
    types.ts
    validations.ts
    sub-route-b.test.ts
  controllers.ts          // functions that are being used on the routes
  index.ts                // routes of example
  types.ts                // types that are needed on example
  example.test.ts
  validations.ts
```
